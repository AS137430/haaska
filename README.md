haaska implements a bridge between a [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) instance and the [Smart Home Skill API](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/smart-home) for Amazon's Alexa. It provides voice control for a connected home managed by Home Assistant, through any Alexa-enabled device.

(Thanks to [@bitglue](https://github.com/bitglue) for his work getting the smart home exposed via HTTP making this slimmed down version possible.)
